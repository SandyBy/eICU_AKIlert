20% of ICU pateints develop AKI. This is associated with negative patient outcomes and economic burden.

Patient outcomes:
* Mortality rate 20-25% higher
* ICU length of stay 3 days longer
Economic burden:
* Adds additional $8000/ stay, or $40,000 if the pateint requires dialysis
* Estimated impact on nnual hospitalization costs $5.4-$24 billion
